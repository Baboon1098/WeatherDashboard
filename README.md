# WeatherDashboard

Created a Simple Html that tells the user its a 5 day forecast and displays the current Date and Weather at the top and the next 5 days below that. This page will also save ur previous search to local storage and then if you wish to search a new city you can clear the search and start again but that search will still be there next page load.
